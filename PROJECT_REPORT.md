---

## 6. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### 6.1 Data Processing
The application processes user input through several stages:
1. **Validation**: Ensures numeric values for Y-axis data
2. **Filtering**: Removes invalid or empty data points
3. **Processing**: For histograms, groups data into frequency bins
4. **Rendering**: Passes processed data to chart components

### 6.2 Chart Generation
**Bar Chart Processing:**
```typescript
const validData = data.filter(d => 
  d && typeof d.y === 'number' && !isNaN(d.y) && d.x
);
```

**Histogram Processing:**
```typescript
const processDataForHistogram = (validData: DataPoint[]) => {
  const values = validData.map(d => d.y);
  const binCount = Math.min(8, Math.max(4, Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(values.length))));
  // Create frequency bins and count occurrences
};
```

### 6.3 State Management
The application uses React's useState hooks for:
- Chart data management
- Chart type selection
- Form state handling
- UI state management
